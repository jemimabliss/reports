# My project is about wolves!!!

i am going to talk about animals in the winter and this is the animal it ama'szing
it's a wolf!! So, wolfs eat  a lot of stuff like fish & raccoons and porcupines & 
squirrels  and chipmunks!!! All of those animals live in the north pole like
in Alaska. I watch lots of Alaska videos. There, awesome wolfs are really fast!

None of you people now how fast these creatures are.Well, cheetahs are faster than wolves. Lots of boys in my school love cheetahs.

Me and my mom love animals!!!!!! some wolfs get trained some are wild 

I seen lots of pictures of wolfs 

I'm the only one in my family that loves wolfs 

wolfs can live anywhere for example pittsburgh but in the forest
wolvs only come out there cave when they want to go outside
